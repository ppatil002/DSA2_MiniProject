<h1>NLTK TOOLKIT IN C</h1>
IMPLEMENTING PORT STEMMER AND WORDNET IN C


### Example of WordNet
![Sample Wordnet](https://github.com/ppatil002/DSA2_MiniProject/blob/master/wordnet.png)


### Steps to implement the toolkit
1. Clone the repository
```sh
git clone "https://github.com/ppatil002/DSA2_MiniProject.git"
```
2. At the project root run:
```sh
make
```
3. Run the command
```sh
./stem
```
## Applications
- Stemming is most common text pre-processing techniques in NLP used to clean the data which makes it easier to process it further
- WordNet is a kind of dictionary which is used to map the relations between different set of words having same common background

```json
   // code for coloring

```
```js
   // code for coloring
```
```css
   // code for coloring
```
