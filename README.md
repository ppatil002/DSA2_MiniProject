<h1>NLTK TOOLKIT IN C</h1>
<h2>IMPLEMENTING PORT STEMMER AND WORDNET IN C</h2>

## Introduction
The Porter stemming algorithm [(‘Porter stemmer’)](https://github.com/ppatil002/DSA2_MiniProject.git) is the process of reducing inflection in words to their root forms such as mapping a group of words to the same stem.</br></br>

[WordNET](https://github.com/ppatil002/DSA2_MiniProject.git) is a lexical database of words in which we have words grouped differently into a set of its root word(Stem  word) where each word in the database is expressing its distinct concept.</br>


### Example of WordNet
![Sample Wordnet](https://github.com/ppatil002/DSA2_MiniProject/blob/master/wordnet.png)


### Steps to implement the toolkit
1. Clone the repository
```sh
git clone "https://github.com/ppatil002/DSA2_MiniProject.git"
```
2. At the project root run:
```sh
make
```
3. Run the command
```sh
./stem
```

## Applications
- [Stemming](https://github.com/ppatil002/DSA2_MiniProject.git) is most common text pre-processing techniques in [NLP](https://github.com/ppatil002/DSA2_MiniProject.git) used to clean the data which makes it easier to process it further
- [WordNet](https://github.com/ppatil002/DSA2_MiniProject.git) is a kind of dictionary which is used to map the relations between different set of words having same common background

## Concepts Used 
1. Graphs
2. Regular Expressions
